## 🎯 What Is This?

A battle-tested collection of **16 professional workflows** and **18 automation scripts** that solve real-world problems in software development and operations. Built on the foundation of safe AI-assisted development, expanded into a complete enterprise toolkit.

### **Core Philosophy**
- **Safety First**: Atomic operations with automatic rollback
- **Automation**: Reduce manual work, increase consistency
- **Best Practices**: Industry-standard patterns baked in
- **Role-Based**: Tools for every team member
- **Production-Ready**: Used in real enterprise environments

## ⚡ Quick Start

# Add rules to your IDE's "Project Rules" or "Custom Instructions"
# See: .agent/rules.md
```

### Your First Workflow

```powershell
# Make code changes safely (zero risk of corruption)
# Follow: .agent/workflows/smart-edit.md

# Review your changes before committing
.agent\scripts\Review-Code.ps1

# Run tests
.agent\scripts\Run-Tests.ps1

# Deploy safely
.agent\scripts\Deploy-Site.ps1 -Target "Stage"
```

- ✅ **Build Automation** - Dependency tracking and incremental builds

### 🏗️ **Architecture & Operations**
- ✅ **Technology Advisor** - AI-assisted stack selection and ADRs
- ✅ **System Operations** - Patch management, deployments, backups, DR
- ✅ **Monitoring Setup** - Observability strategy (Prometheus, DataDog, ELK)
- ✅ **Logging Strategy** - Centralized logging and best practices

### 👥 **Team Support**
- ✅ **Developer Onboarding** - Automated environment setup
- ✅ **Integration Testing** - End-to-end validation
- ✅ **Git Workflow** - Safe branching and merging

### ⚡ **Helper Scripts System** (NEW!)
