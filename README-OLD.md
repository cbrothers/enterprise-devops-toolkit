# Antigravity Safe Git Workflow

A bulletproof AI-assisted development workflow using JSON-based patching, flexible whitespace matching, Git integration, and comprehensive safety features.

## 🎯 What Is This?

This workflow solves the common problem of AI coding assistants corrupting files due to:
- Indentation errors
- Line ending inconsistencies  
- Escaping issues in multi-line code blocks
- Lack of verification and rollback

**Solution:** A PowerShell-based "Smart Patch" system that uses JSON for input, flexible regex for matching, Git for safety, **plus** automated code review, security auditing, and performance profiling.

## ✨ What's New (Enhanced Version)

### Critical Safety Improvements
- ✅ **Atomic Operations**: Rollback mechanism using Git stash - all patches succeed or all fail
- ✅ **Pre-Patch Validation**: Validates all patches before applying any
- ✅ **Ambiguous Match Detection**: Errors if multiple matches found (prevents silent partial replacements)
- ✅ **Enhanced Binary Guard**: 20+ additional file types protected (fonts, videos, audio)
- ✅ **Deployment Safety**: Pre-flight checks ensure clean working directory and branch sync

### New Senior Developer Workflows
- 🔍 **Code Review**: Automated security, quality, and performance analysis
- 🔒 **Security Audit**: Comprehensive vulnerability scanning
- ⚡ **Performance Profiling**: Execution time and memory benchmarking

## 🚀 Quick Start

### For New Projects

1. Navigate to your project root:
   ```powershell
   cd C:\Path\To\YourProject
   ```

2. Run the bootstrap script:
   ```powershell
   & "C:\Path\To\Bootstrap-AIWorkflow.ps1"
   ```

3. Add the rules from `.agent/rules.md` to your IDE's "Project Rules" or "Custom Instructions"

4. Start patching!

└── .gitignore                      # Updated with AI workflow exclusions
```

## 🔧 How It Works

### The Workflow (3 Steps)

1. **Draft**: Create a `patch.json` file:
   ```json
   {
     "file": "src/app.js",
     "search": "function oldCode() {\n  return 'old';\n}",
     "replace": "function newCode() {\n  return 'new';\n}"
   }
   ```

2. **Apply**: Run the patcher:
   ```powershell
   .agent/scripts/Apply-SmartPatch.ps1 -PatchFile "patch.json"
   ```

3. **Verify**: Read the Git diff output and confirm the change.

### Key Features

- ✅ **Exact Match First**: Tries exact string matching for speed
- ✅ **Flexible Fallback**: Uses regex with whitespace normalization if exact fails
- ✅ **Git Integration**: Shows diffs, creates backups, supports branching
- ✅ **Binary Guard**: Prevents accidental corruption of images/binaries
- ✅ **Auto-Commit**: Optional auto-commit when using feature branches

- **[Smart Edit Workflow](workflows/smart-edit.md)** - Step-by-step usage guide

## 🛠️ Advanced Usage

### Feature Branch Mode

```powershell
.agent/scripts/Apply-SmartPatch.ps1 -PatchFile "patch.json" -BranchName "ai/new-feature"
```

This will:
1. Create/checkout the branch
2. Apply the patch
3. Auto-commit with a descriptive message

### Error Handling

If a patch fails:
- The script outputs the error (e.g., "Search text not found")
- The file is **not modified** (safe by default)
- Fix your `search` block in `patch.json` and retry

## 🤖 IDE Integration

### Antigravity / Cursor / Windsurf

Add this to your **Project Rules**:

```markdown
# Code Editing Protocol (MANDATORY)
You MUST use the "Smart Patch" workflow for all file modifications.
See .agent/rules.md for full documentation.
```

## 🌟 Why This Approach?

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| AI hallucinates indentation | Flexible whitespace regex matching |
| Escaping nightmares in CLI | JSON input with proper escaping |
| No verification | Git diff output for every change |
| Accidental corruption | Binary file guard + automatic backups |
| Hard to rollback | Git integration with optional branching |
